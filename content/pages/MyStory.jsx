    <h2>Hi, I'm Marek. ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p style={{ fontSize: 20, color: "#312e81", marginBottom: "0.5em" }}>
      I'm using modern web tech to lead web apps development through the whole
      implementation process - from figma boards to full-fledged product launch.
    </p>
    <Separator />
    <p>
      I'm passionate about the possibilities that web dev ecosystem gives us
      today and the direction toward which it's heading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the beginning of my journey as a software developer over 7 years
      ago, I've collaborated with talented people in companies ranging from
      small businesses, through software agencies, in-house developing tech
      companies to big e-commerce stores with millions of active users to create
      digital products for both business and consumer use. In each one of them,
      I've been observing that to excel in delivering accurate and reliable
      software, it's necessary to focus not only on software architecture and
      web technologies but also on being able to respond to change and being
      able to choose and facilitate proper development process for the team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not only a web developer - I'm also engaged part-time in helping my
      wife with her business as a communication skills trainer and in
      homeschooling my children. This fascinates me as much as software
      development. I've always been defining myself as a "people person" and I
      see that skills like effective communication, passion for teaching, having
      a collaborative mindset, and open-minded attitude are very beneficial in
      software development teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm self-organized and able to work independently. Taking ownership of
      what I do over the years made me always mindful of the broader perspective
      of tasks I do and engaged in verifying the business value, sometimes even
      a little too much ðŸ˜….
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m a curious person and a fast learner. My passions and hobbies include
      many other things than software development: reading{" "}

      <a href="https://9gag.com/">meme sites</a> way more than I should,{" "}

      and acrobatics, nature hikes and simply goofing around with my wife and
      kids.
