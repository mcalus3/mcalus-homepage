[recursive-buttons] is a simple decorative react component that you can import as a library. It's inspired by a geometric shape called [Sierpinski carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet) and bubble wrap popping. You can use it in your project as a [component library](https://github.com/mcalus3/recursive-buttons).

[open-fraksl] is a generative art app. It allows user to compose unique fractal images by combining different patterns, color palletes, and textures. It's also interesting as a benchmark of current WebGL graphics for browser apps. It can smoothly render and move hundreds of thousands of sprites in async rendering.

[color-wars] is my mini-game created in react and redux architecture. It's my first project created in React and it fulfilled my childhood dream to create my own game.
