## My Projects

### recursive-buttons

[recursive-buttons] is an experiment with recursive react components inspired by poking bubble wrap. I'm currently developing this and preparing to publish as a library.

### open-fraksl

[open-fraksl] is a generative art app. It allows user to compose unique fractal images by combining different patterns, color palletes, and textures. It's also interesting as a benchmark of current WebGL graphics for browser apps. It can smoothly render and move hundreds of thousands of sprites in async rendering.

### color-wars

[color-wars] is my mini-game created in react and redux architecture. It's my first project created in React and it fulfilled my childhood dream to create my own game.
