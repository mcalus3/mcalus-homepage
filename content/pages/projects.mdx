[Trusted Twin](https://trustedtwin.com/) is a developer platform for secure and decentralized data sharing based on the digital twin concept.

[recursive-buttons] is a react component inspired by two things - a fractal shape called [Sierpinski carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_carpet) and bubble wrap popping. You can use it in your project as an [imported component](https://github.com/mcalus3/recursive-buttons).

[open-fraksl] is a generative art app. It allows user to compose unique fractal images by combining different patterns, color palletes, and textures. It's also interesting as a benchmark of current WebGL graphics for browser apps. It can smoothly render and move hundreds of thousands of sprites in async rendering.
