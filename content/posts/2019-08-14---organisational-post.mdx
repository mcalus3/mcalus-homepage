Hi!

I haven't been writing anything here for three months, buuuuuut… I was doing other things instead :P

Apart from just having little time, I became more interested in writing my pet project: [open-fraksl](https://openfraksl.netlify.com) and decided to just go with the flow. It turned out that I don't have sufficient motivation to write yet another react course, so I'll start writing on another topic - I'll keep a devlog here. I'll try to describe some interesting points and discoveries I made recently during working on open-fraksl. Maybe I'll start frm the beginning to explain my inspiration and inner workings of this app, but it will come out. Stay tuned 🤓

Sincerely yours,<br />
