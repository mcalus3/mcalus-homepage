### Rampage mode for the mouse and touchscreens

<div>
  <div style="width: 100px; height: 50px; float: left; margin-right: 16px; margin-top: 8px">
    <RecursiveButtons hoverMode text="hover over me!"/>
  </div>

I've added something called "rampage mode" to recursiveButtons. In this mode, buttons are being clicked as soon as the user hovers a cursor over them. You can see below that for mouse events it requires just one change:

</div>

<CodeSandbox
  url="recursive-buttons-04-sdjuz"
  params={{
    module: "/src/RecursiveButton.jsx",
    highlights: "14",
   }}
  title="recursive-buttons-04"
/>

<div style="width: 400px; height: 25px;">
  <RecursiveButtons text="" />
</div>

Then I tried to enable it also for touch events - I was thinking that it will be equally easy. But it wasn't. Solving it took me two days.

First, it turned out that Touch events _capture_ the element on which touch action has started. To visualize it, I've created the example below:

- first, try to click and "drag" over multiple buttons with mouse cursor - you will be painting all the buttons along the way
- then open devtools (f12), enter ["responsive design mode"](/media/image-17.png) and try to repeat the same (browser will simulate touch events instead of mouse). You will see that only first button is being colored

<CodeSandbox
  url="touch-capture-example-1s6fq"
  params={{
    module: "/src/App.js",
   }}
  title="touch-capture-example-01"
/>

Although surprisingly inconsistent for developers, it's justified for typical mobile usage - when user drags something on small screen (let's say, a slider input), he doesn't want to accidentally touch other things on the way - the browser assumes that until user releases his finger, he doesn't want to touch anything else.

Unfortunately, I am at this unique situation in which I _need_ it to touch other elements. It took me a lot of searching to finally get to [some _stack overflow_ page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8813051/determine-which-element-the-mouse-pointer-is-on-top-of-in-javascript
), on which someone suggested such a solution in which I have to read x and y posiotions from the touch event and then use a `document.elementFromPoint()` function to get the real element under the touch pointer Then I can invoke a "click" event on it and it will trigger a click handler installed in a react component for this element. And it worked:

<CodeSandbox
  url="touch-capture-example-2-e0xxq"
  params={{
    module: "/src/App.js",
    highlights: "10,11,12,13,14,36,37,38,39,40"
   }}
  title="touch-capture-example-03"
/>

<div style="width: 400px; height: 25px;">
  <RecursiveButtons text="" />
</div>

### Prolonging the event for an element that is being unmounted

I had yet one more problem to solve - _event target_ is the element that I touch, not the element that has the handler (in my case handler is attached to the parent of all buttons). If the target is being unmounted during the touch event, the `touchMove` event stops being fired.

<CodeSandbox
  url="touch-capture-example-3-54xcb"
  params={{
    module: "/src/App.js",
    highlights: "4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24"
   }}
  title="touch-capture-example-03"
/>

Luckily, I've found [another workaround for this issue on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33298828/touch-move-event-dont-fire-after-touch-start-target-is-removed). It suggested to "programatically" add the `touchmove` and `touchend` (this one just for cleanup) events to a target when the click starts. I don't know exactly why, but it's enough to have this event living loner than a target that it's initially attached to. 

And that's how I've finally made it:

<CodeSandbox
  url="touch-capture-example-4-2l6lb"
  params={{
    module: "/src/customTouchHandler.js",
   }}
  title="touch-capture-example-04"
/>

Happy button popping ðŸ˜Š
