I'm working with VSCode for quite some time and I like that it exposes a lot of actions to be configured as shortcut keys. I've configured some of them myself:

1. Terminal switch

When I work on frontend apps I always need more than one terminal processes opened. VSCode supports multiple terminals, but to switch between them fast (without using mouse), you have to bind a shortcut to terminal switch (next and previous on `ctrl` + `'` and `ctrl` + `;`). This way I can not only quickly switch between terminal windows, but also switch focus to it from the code file.

2. Open a new terminal

I use it sometimes - opening a new terminal is `ctrl` + `` ` `` by default in the VS Code.

3. Terminal extend/retract

When I work on laptop, i normally decrease height of my terminal window to couple of lines, to maximize size of the visible source code. But often when I want to read something longer in the terminal (like test output) I expand it with mouse. Having to changing it back and forth multiple times was starting to be exhausting for me, so I've found a keyboard shortcut to expand and retract it. I've configured it to `ctrl` + `shift` + `'`.

4. Go back

`alt` + `leftArrow` and `alt` + `rightArrow` are the shortcuts to navigate back and forth the lines of code you've had your cursor on. It's the shortcut used most often by me.

4. Go to definition/usage

Second most used shortcut for navigating code - go to definition - `F12` and go to usage - `Shift` + `F12`.

5. Go to file

When pressing `ctrl` + `p` you'll open a pane to search files by name. Alternatively, when you want to go to symbol (variable, function etc.), press `ctrl` + `t`

6. rename

Rename is `F2`, it's the most common used one, but it took me couple of years to realize that I can also rename files quicker by pressing `F2` wneh having them focused in the explorer pane.

Sincerely yours,<br />
